## Tourism Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed tourism data to identify regional trends in visitor numbers, revenue, and customer satisfaction. The insights gained can inform strategic decisions to improve tourism performance across regions.

### Objective
To analyze tourism data to identify key regional trends, customer behavior, and areas for improvement in the tourism industry, supporting better decision-making and growth.

### Key Insights

- **Tourist Visits by Region**:  The **South** and **West** regions recorded the highest tourist visits, with **10.5K** and **10.1K** respectively. In contrast, the **East region** underperformed significantly, attracting only **5.6K** visitors. This highlights a need for improved tourism appeal and targeted promotions in the East to draw more visitors.

 - **Revenue Distribution by Region**:   **South** and **West** generated the most revenue, contributing **25%** and **24%** respectively. The **East** lagged behind with only **13.32%**. To address this, targeted marketing campaigns and tourism development initiatives in the East region should be prioritized to increase both tourist visits and revenue.

- **Customer Satisfaction**:   The **South** had the highest satisfaction at **4.5**, compared to the **Central regionâ€™s 3.9**, which is the lowest. To boost satisfaction, the Central region could benefit from improved service quality, staff training, and better amenities.

- **Seasonality of Tourist Activity**:   Tourist visits peak **mid-year** but decline toward **year-end**, indicating strong seasonality. To mitigate the drop in activity during the off-peak months, introducing off-season promotions and targeted marketing campaigns can help sustain interest and generate steady revenue throughout the year.
