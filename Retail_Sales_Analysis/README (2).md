# Retail Sales Analysis
This project analyzes sales data from two retail stores to identify performance differences, product trends, and key insights that can inform business decisions.

## Objective  
To evaluate and compare sales performance between Store A and Store B, identify high and low-performing products, and uncover trends that can guide inventory management and marketing strategies.

## Key Insights  

- **Overall Store Performance**: Store A generated **$38,000** in sales, while Store B generated **$27,000**, indicating stronger overall performance by Store A. The gap may be partly due to category-level differences in performance.


- **Product Category Comparison**:  
  Store A outperformed in most categories, particularly **Electronics** (A: 152, B: 75) and **Clothing** (A: 111, B: 69), while Store B led slightly in **Books** (B: 128, A: 117). These differences suggest varying customer preferences or lower demand for certain categories in Store Bâ€™s location.

- **Top-Selling Product**: The **Smartphone** was the highest-selling product across both stores, indicating strong demand in Electronics. This can help prioritize stock for future sales.

- **Least-Selling Products**: The **Sweater** was sold in Store A but had **zero sales in Store B**. This could indicate either stock issues, lower customer demand, or the product not being marketed effectively in Store B. The **Jeans** and **Monitors** also had minimal sales across both stores, suggesting possible inventory challenges or low customer interest.

- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Sales peaked in **June** and were lowest in **December**, suggesting seasonal demand fluctuations. The year-end drop may indicate a need for targeted promotions during the holiday season.
